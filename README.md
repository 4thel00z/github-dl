#github-dl

A small tool to download any file from github.
Prompts you for a search query parameter. You can search via type complete through the search results.
The same goes for the found files in the repository.

This script needs the GITHUB_DOWNLOADER_TOKEN env variable to be set to a personal access token.
You can get that one here: https://github.com/settings/tokens.

Set it in your .bashrc/.zshrc for convenience.

Install the dependencies via pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt.
